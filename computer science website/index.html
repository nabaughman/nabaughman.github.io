<h2>About Me:</h2>

<div class="boxed">
<p>Hi, my name is Nathanael Baughman. I am 22 years old and am currently in the process of acquiring my BFA in Graphic Design from Bob Jones University in Greenville SC. I havenâ€™t always lived in Greenville, however. I have lived abroad for many years of my life, spending some of middle school living in Paris, most of high school studying in Hong Kong, and then several years in southwestern CT, about an hour from NYC.  This multicultural experience has helped push me outside of my comfort zone and I believe benefits me as an artist and designer. My interests include all things artistic, mainly digital design, photography, and fashion. Outside of that, I enjoy finding good quality tv shows, video games with engaging and intriguing stories, and searching around the Greenville area for photogenic places to hike and take photos of.
